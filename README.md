## Projects

### 1: ShopEasy
- **Description**:  An e-commerce website where customers can browse products, add them to their cart or wishlist, and complete a simple checkout process without payment.  
There are two user roles: Admin and Customer. Admins have full control to add, edit, and view all products, while customers can only browse products and add them to their cart or wishlist. A search option is available to quickly find products. After checkout, customers receive an email with their bill details.

### 2: FreeSpace
- **Description**:  A website that connects frequent flyers with excess luggage space to individuals who need to send items. Users can create posts by providing details like departure and arrival cities, dates, weight, price per kg, and volume. The platform features a search option with multiple filters such as weight, date, city, and country, helping users find the most relevant posts.  
Those looking to send items can browse the available posts, select the one that suits their needs, and contact the post owner.
The post owner receives a notification and can mark the message as read to initiate private communication, making the process seamless and efficient.

### 3: HCMS (Health Care Management System)
- **Description**: Part of the team that developed a Healthcare Management System to streamline the process of booking appointments and managing staff. The system allows admins to add doctors with specific domains, days, and timings via a dropdown menu. Patients can then book appointments with the selected doctor based on their availability.  
When an appointment is booked or canceled by the admin, a confirmation popup appears, ensuring clarity for every action. Additionally, email notifications are automatically sent to the patient when an appointment is confirmed or canceled, keeping patients informed at all stages.

### 4: Matching Card Game
- **Description**:  A fun and engaging web-based, 3-level memory card-matching game that tests players' memory and quick thinking. Players need to match pairs of cards, but with each level, the difficulty increases. Features include a win-loss mechanism, dynamic scoring, and a pause/resume option for added convenience.  
As the game progresses, players face increasing challenges—more cards, negative markings for wrong matches, a limited number of clicks, and time constraints to make each level more thrilling. This game keeps players on their toes and offers a fun way to improve memory and decision-making skills.

### 5: Intel Image Classification
- **Description**:  Developed an image classification software that predicts images across six scene categories—forest, sea, buildings, glaciers, mountains, and streets—with an accuracy of 92.3%. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and is trained on a dataset of 25,000 natural scene images, each of size 150x150, sourced from Kaggle.  
The dataset is divided into training (14k images), testing (3k images), and prediction (7k images) sets. The model is capable of classifying images based on these six categories.

The system enforces several business rules, such as preventing room reservations on weekends, disallowing overlapping reservations, and limiting reservation duration to 30 minutes. This ensures smooth and efficient room management for the institution.
